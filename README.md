# 🌿 AutoIrrigator

**AutoIrrigator** is a customizable, Arduino-powered irrigation system designed to automate plant watering based on user-defined intervals and durations. Whether you're growing herbs on a windowsill or managing a small garden, this DIY solution helps ensure consistent hydration with minimal effort and maximum control.

---

## 🛠️ Project Overview

This project combines hardware simplicity with functional flexibility. Using two potentiometers, users can set:
- **Watering Interval** – how often the plants should be watered.
- **Watering Duration** – how long each watering session should last.

The system uses a relay to control a solenoid valve, which regulates water flow. All components are housed in a **custom-designed 3D-printed casing**, offering both protection and aesthetic appeal.

## 🔩 Hardware Components

- [**Arduino Uno/Nano**]() – Microcontroller for timing and control logic.
- [**2 Potentiometers**](https://amzn.in/d/5XguNF9) –  
  - One for setting the interval between watering cycles.  
  - One for setting the duration of each watering session.
- [**Relay Module**](https://amzn.in/d/4JJ3AoD) – Safely switches the solenoid valve on and off.
- [**Solenoid Valve**](https://amzn.in/d/5VcodRB) – Controls the flow of water to the plants. 
- [**3D-Printed Casing**](https://github.com/thecrazyphysicist369/automatic-irrigator/blob/main/3d%20models.zip) – Designed and printed by the creator to house all components securely and neatly.
- [**5V power supply**](https://amzn.in/d/fB40K1k) – To power the Arduino and the relay.
- [**12V power supply**](https://amzn.in/d/bbHhZrX) – To power the solenoid valve.
